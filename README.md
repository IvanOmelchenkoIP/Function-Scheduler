# Function-Scheduler
An updated version of the Scheduler class from my OP Coursework of 2nd semester 1st year

## FunctionScheduler
Now only menages running of tasks and is dependant on instances of TaskManager class. Can now pause and resume running tasks. 

## TaskContainer
Is a class, instances of which contain tasks that are needed to be run. Default arguments can be added here and also the arguments that will be applied when calling tasks anyways. Several tasks are supported
